# System Cleanup & Finalization Report
## Date: December 9, 2025

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Internal Server Error (500)**
**Problem:** Auto-detection code tried to access `$_SERVER` during config boot before web context was available.

**Solution:** Changed `APP_URL` from a constant to a helper function `getAppUrl()` that:
- Only accesses `$_SERVER` when called (not during boot)
- Detects CLI mode and returns safe default
- Auto-detects protocol (http/https), host, and base path
- Falls back to `.env` configuration if present

**Files Modified:**
- `config.php` - Added `getAppUrl()` helper function (lines 38-62)
- `admin/api/qr_helper.php` - Uses `getAppUrl()` instead of hardcoded IP (lines 13-18)

---

## Environment Adaptation System

### How It Works:
```
1. Check .env file → APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
2. If not found → Auto-detect from $_SERVER
3. CLI mode → Return localhost default
4. Web mode → Extract from HTTP_HOST + SCRIPT_NAME
```

### Supports All Environments:
 **Local Development**: `http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID` 
 **WiFi Testing**: `http://192.168.1.39/Vehiscan-RFID` 
 **InfinityFree Hosting**: `https://yourdomain.infinityfreeapp.com` 
 **Custom Domain**: Any domain you configure

## File Cleanup Recommendations

### Files to DELETE (Testing/Debug files with hardcoded IPs):
```
_testing/regenerate_all_qr_codes.php - Hardcoded 192.168.1.39
_testing/test_visitor_pass_urls.php - Hardcoded 192.168.1.39
_testing/test_https_redirect.php - Hardcoded 192.168.1.39
visitor/qr_test.php - Hardcoded test token
dev-tools/homeowner_registration_backup.php - Old backup
dev-tools/guard_panel_improved_backup.js - Old backup
```

### Files to KEEP (Active system files):
```
config.php Fixed with getAppUrl()
admin/api/qr_helper.php Uses dynamic URL
db.php Uses config
includes/security_headers.php Active security
```

---

## Code Overlaps Found

### 1. **Configuration Loading**
- `config.php` - Main config (KEEP)
- `.env.production` - Template for hosting (KEEP)
- Both work together correctly

### 2. **QR Code Generation**
- `admin/api/qr_helper.php` - Main generator (KEEP) Fixed
- `_testing/regenerate_all_qr_codes.php` - Test script (DELETE)

### 3. **Guard Panel JS**
- `guard/js/guard-config.js` - Base URL config (KEEP)
- `guard/js/guard_side.js` - Main logic (KEEP)
- `dev-tools/guard_panel_improved_backup.js` - Old backup (DELETE)

**No critical overlaps** - Files serve different purposes or are backups.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Internal Server Error 500 FIXED
**Cause:** Accessing `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` during config initialization 
**Fix:** Made `getAppUrl()` a callable function instead of boot-time constant 

### Bug #2: Hardcoded IP Address FIXED
**Cause:** `192.168.1.39` hardcoded in qr_helper.php line 17 
**Fix:** Replaced with `getAppUrl()` dynamic detection 

### Bug #3: QR Codes Not Working on Hosting FIXED
**Cause:** Local IP doesn't work on internet 
**Fix:** Auto-detects hosting domain from HTTP headers

## Deployment Instructions

### For Localhost Testing:
1. No changes needed - auto-detects `http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID`
2. Works with XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP

### For WiFi Testing (Mobile):
1. Create `.env` file:
   ```env
   APP_URL=http://192.168.1.39/Vehiscan-RFID
   ```
2. Or let it auto-detect from your network IP

### For Hosting:
1. Create `.env` file on server:
   ```env
   APP_URL=https://your-domain.example.com
   DB_HOST=your-db-host.example.com
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASS=your_database_password
   ```
2. Upload files via FTP
3. QR codes will automatically use your hosting domain

## Testing Checklist

### Localhost Testing:
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Create visitor pass
- [ ] Check QR code URL contains `http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID`
- [ ] Scan QR code (should redirect correctly)
- [ ] Test guard panel log refresh

### Hosting Testing:
- [ ] Upload all files to InfinityFree
- [ ] Create `.env` with hosting domain
- [ ] Test admin login
- [ ] Create visitor pass
- [ ] Check QR code URL contains hosting domain
- [ ] Scan QR code from phone (internet connection)
- [ ] Verify guard panel works
